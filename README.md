# PCBS_CellularAutomata

A cellular automaton is a discrete dynamical system that models behaviours based on a certain set of rules. It is represented by a collection of cells in a grid that evolve through time, depending on the states of their neighbours.

 A few examples of cellular automata :

- the Game of Life : developed by John Conway, this automaton models the growth of a population depending on the number of surrounding neighbours.
- the Schelling segregation model : developed by Thomas Schelling, this automaton models a population where each individual has a small preference for being surrounded by kin and how this leads to group segregation.
- the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model : developed by Kai Nagel and Michael Schreckenberg, this automaton models traffic flow and how traffic jams emerge from interactions between cars.
- cellular automata can also be used to model biological processes such as patterns in nature (for example seashell patterns) and complex cognitive behaviours (for example neural interactions, perception and learning).

The goal of this project is to implement John Conway's \"Game of Life" in python (using the PyGame library), and maybe also one or two other examples of cellular automata.
